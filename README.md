# Basic "FundMe" project from Foundry 2023 course

## Complete
- Some scripts to deploy, help, and interact with the FundMe.sol contract
- Some unit tests and integration/interaction tests related to FundMe.sol and its scripts
- Basic makefile to test simple *nix CI/CD with Forge

## To Do
- If I feel the urge, I can improve test coverage
- Play around with the foundry-devops package (maybe check out alternatives)
- Really understand Interactions.t.sol

## Notes
This is just a basic first run of Mstr. Collins' 2023 Foundry course.  I'm grateful for the experience, but still have plenty to go.
